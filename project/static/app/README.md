# React - Mobx boilerplate

Have a quick start with React and mobx.

## Quick start

```
npm i
npm start
```

## Options
The app is very minimalistic by default, this is the master branch.
The idea is to create specific Git branches where I've added something that is optional, like react router.

You can either check or cherry pick these commits to make your own setup.

### Master
Basic minimal setup

### Less
Less added for CSS preprocessing.

### React-router
Added react router with a simple routing example.
